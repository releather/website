        How to Buy Leather for Upholstery Guide

        When it comes to choosing the right upholstery material for your home, genuine leather is often the superior choice. Leather is durable, easy to clean, and has a classic look that never goes out of style. In addition, leather is a natural material are more breathable and will age gracefully. Upholstery leather can also be more comfortable than other materials, as it tends to be softer and cooler to the touch. Whether you&apos;re looking for a timeless sofa or a chic accent chair, leather upholstered furniture is always a smart choice.

      <GuideSection>The types of upholstery leather hides</GuideSection>
      <p>→ Full Grain Leather, Top Grain Leather.</p>

      <p>
        When leather is used for furniture upholstery, it generally falls into one of four categories: full-grain leather, top-grain leather, genuine leather, or bonded leather. Full grain leather is the highest quality leather available and is made from the outermost layer of the hide. Top grain leather is also made from the outermost layer of the hide, but it has been sanded or buffed to remove any imperfections. Genuine leather is made from the innermost layers of the hide and is usually pigmented to provide uniform color. <Link href="/what-is-bonded-leather" title="What is Bonded Leather">Bonded Leather</Link> consists of bits and pieces of leather that have been glued or otherwise bonded together. So, when you&apos;re looking for leather furniture, be sure to ask for full-grain or top-grain leather; avoid faux leather, split leather, pu leather, and bonded leather. Real leather will last longer and be more comfortable than any of those other options.

      <GuideSection>How to choose the right leather upholstery for your home?</GuideSection>
      <p>→ Protected Leather, Unprotected Leather.</p>

      <p>
        There are a few things to keep in mind in order to choose the right leather for your home and understanding the type of leather is essential. The first thing to consider is the level of wear and tear that the leather sofa will be subjected to. If you have active kids or pets, you&apos;ll want to choose a durable top grain leather that can withstand some abuse, stain resistant, and easy to clean. We recommend <strong>Protected</strong> aniline dyed leather upholstery such as <Link href="/types-of-leather#Pigmented-Leather" title="Pigmented Aniline Leather">Pigmented</Link>, <Link href="/types-of-leather#Corrected-Leather" title="Corrected Aniline Leather">Corrected grain</Link>, <Link href="/types-of-leather#Semi-Aniline-Leather" title="Semi-Aniline Leather">Semi-Aniline</Link> leather. These upholstery leather hides are more uniform in color or can have a two-tone texture finish. Secondly, consider the climate and direct sunlight in your home. If you live in a dry climate, you&apos;ll want to choose a leather that is treated for moisture resistance or routinely use a <Link href="/leather-conditioner" title="Leather Conditioner for Leather Upholstery Furniture">Leather Conditioner</Link> to keep your leather soft and moisturized.         If you live in a hot and humid climate, <strong>Unprotected</strong> leather material will fade and crack in the heat much faster because they are not finished with a protective coating.

        Finally, consider your personal style. Do you prefer a classic look, rustic leather look, or something more modern? There are many different types of leather hides available in a wide range of colors and textures, so take your time to find the perfect match for your home. <Link href="/types-of-leather#Pure-Aniline" title="Pure Aniline Leather">Pure Aniline</Link> and <Link href="/types-of-leather#Nubuck" title="Nubuck Aniline Leather">Nubuck</Link> leather are considered the highest quality full grain leather and command a higher price point.

          Leather is a material made from the skins of animals, usually a cow. The process of making leather begins by soaking the skin in a chemical solution that helps to break down the tissue and remove any hair or other debris. Once the skin has been prepared, it is stretched and dried, then treated with another chemical solution that helps to preserve it. Tanning involves soaking the hide in a mixture of water, chromium salts, and chemicals, which helps to preserve it and make it more flexible. Finally, the leather is dyed and finished to give it a smooth, soft, consistent surface. Leather is commonly used for upholstery, clothing, and a variety of other products. Thanks to its durability and resistance to wear and tear, leather is an ideal material for many different applications.

      <GuideSection>How long does upholstery leather last?</GuideSection>
      <p>→ Durability, Leather Care, Leather Repair Service</p>

      <p>
        If you&apos;re considering leather for your furniture upholstery, you might be wondering how long it will last. The answer, of course, depends on a number of factors, including the quality of the leather and how it&apos;s used. Generally speaking, leather is a very durable material that can last for many years. With proper care, it&apos;s not unusual for leather furniture to last for decades. Of course, this doesn&apos;t mean that leather is indestructible. Like any other material, it can be damaged by spills, scratching, or sun exposure. But with proper care, leathers can provide years of beauty and comfort. Leathers can wear from normal use but unlike faux leather, fabrics, and even suede, upholstery leather can be restored and dyed to offer added longevity. Most aniline leather hides are suitable for our <Link href="/services/leather-restoration" title="Leather Restoration Service">Leather Restoration</Link> and <Link href="/services/leather-dyeing" title="Leather Dyeing Service">Leather Dyeing</Link> service.

          Whenever you&apos;re leather furniture shopping, whether it&apos;s for new sofas or chairs, there are a few things you should keep in mind. First, avoid faux leather, split leather, pu leather, and <Link href="/types-of-leather#Bonded-Leather" title="Bonded Leather">bonded leather</Link>. These materials may look like real leather, but they&apos;re not as durable or as comfortable as real leather. It goes without saying, secondly, always opt for the best leather for your home. Leather furniture is not only more comfortable, but it also last longer than other materials including upholstery fabric. So when you&apos;re leather shopping, keep these things in mind and you&apos;ll be sure to find the perfect furniture piece for your home.

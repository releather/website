        <strong>Aniline leather</strong> is the most exclusive and natural
        choice. Aniline tanning dyes through the hide leaving a rich
        transparent color and minor surface characteristics such as brands,
        insect bites, scars, pores, and other marks. The supple texture adds a
        warm and soft feel. The absorbent and unprotected nature makes it prone
        to sun damage, color fading, and water spotting, stains and spills.
        Special leather care and maintenance is required.

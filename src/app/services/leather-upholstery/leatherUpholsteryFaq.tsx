        Often the most luxurious leather is not the most suitable for everyday
        family use. Aniline leather is categorized as the most expansive,
        specifically for its natural look and soft feel. If durability and easy
        maintenance is the priority, protected or pigmented leathers are a better
        choice. With proper care and cleaning, all genuine leathers should last
        for many years.

          We carry Italian leather upholstery for a reason. Leather finished in
          Italy have sophisticated tanning processes and artisan finishing
          (polishing, wax and oil treatments, unique texture effects).

          Some imported leather is manufactured to internationally recognized
          standards. Domestic American leather tanneries comply with the same
          standards. We carry European and American manufactured leather hides.

        Most customers look for a combination of durability and easy cleaning
        in their leather furniture. Protected leather are well suited for this
        purpose. Most liquid spills can be spot cleaned and wiped off.

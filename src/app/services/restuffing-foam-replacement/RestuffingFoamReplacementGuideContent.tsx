        Why Replace Foam & Restuff Cushions?
      </GuideSection>
      <p>
        If you&apos;re looking for a <em>cost-effective and efficient way to improve the comfort and durability of your seating</em>, High Resilience Foam (HR Foam) is a great solution. At ReLeather, we specialize in using HR Foam to replace old, worn-out seat foams, giving your furniture a new lease on life.
      </p>

      <GuideSection id="hr-foam">
        What is HR Foam?
      </GuideSection>
      <p>
        High Resiliency Foam is a type of foam that is designed to be highly resilient and durable, making it an ideal material for use in furniture. Unlike traditional foam, which tends to lose its shape and support over time, HR Foam is designed to maintain its shape and support, even after years of use. This means that furniture that is made with HR Foam will stay comfortable and supportive for much longer than furniture that is made with traditional foam.

        What is the best foam grade for seat cushions?
      </GuideSection>
      <p>
        High Resilience Foam comes in various firmness levels, ranging from very soft (HR 16) to medium (HR 31) to very firm (HR 61). At ReLeather, we generally recommend using HR 31 because this grade strikes a balance between softness and firmness, providing a comfortable seat while maintaining proper support without sinking.

        What is Cushion Restuffing?
      </GuideSection>
      <p>
        Re-stuffing cushions is important to maintain the shape and comfort of your furniture. There are different types of stuffing materials that can be used, such as polyester dacron, fiber, and down feather. Cushion refilling can be advantageous over replacing them entirely as it is cost-effective and can help extend the life of your furniture. The process of re-stuffing cushions involves removing the old stuffing material and replacing it with new stuffing material. This can help restore the cushion&apos;s shape, provide a extra soft feel and better support.

        We perform different types of refilling solutions based on your cushioning: <em>Full Wrap</em> covers the entire foam insert with dacron padding, <em>Top Wrap</em> is placed on top or inserted into the top envelope of the foam insert, and <em>Book Wrap</em> wraps around the front of the foam insert.

          It&apos;s a miracle. We had two 9 foot leather sofas that looked almost ready to send off to Goodwill...discolored, springs gone, needing padding and cracking leather arms. After ReLeather, they look like new. We sit firmly and comfortably and the color is restored to the original. We are more than over the moon. Also it was pleasant working with Roberto and his father. They are professional, honest and trustworthy. Would highly recommend them to our closest friends/family. Thanks ReLeather. Great job!

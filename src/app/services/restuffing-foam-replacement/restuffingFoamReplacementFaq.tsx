    answer: (
      <p>
        We can offer Refilling or Foam Replacement for both loose and fixed
        upholstered cushions. However, we factor additional labor cost for
        fixed upholstery. Please note that fixed upholstery refers to seat
        cushions that are attached or sewn into the furniture frame.

    question:
      "Q. What's the difference between Refilling Restuffing and Foam Replacement?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Refilling adds a layer of padding (fiber and polyester) to the
        cushions. Foam Replacement replaces the old foam with new high density
        foam.

    question: "Q. What are the differences between HR Foam and Memory Foam?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          High resilience (HR) foam is a type of polyurethane foam that can
          quickly return to its original shape, even after prolonged use, unlike
          memory foam, which has a slower response time. With its durable and
          supportive qualities, HR foam is an excellent choice for those looking
          to replace their old, worn-out seat cushions.

        No. We do not provide a service to refill down feathers for your

    question:
      "Q. How often should Leather Seat Cushions be Refilled , Foam Replaced?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        The frequency of refilling or foam replacement for leather seat cushions
        largely depends on the amount of use they receive. Generally, leather
        seat cushions can last for several years before requiring any servicing.
        However, if you notice that your cushions are sagging, flattening, or
        losing their shape, it may be time to consider refilling or foam
        replacement. It&apos;s also important to note that exposure to sunlight,
        heat, and humidity can accelerate wear and tear, so it&apos;s essential
        to take good care of your leather furniture to ensure its longevity.

    question: "Q. Can you fix overstuffed cushions?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes. We provide a solution to your overstuffed cushions by removing any
        excess padding or stuffing. Cushions that are too full can be
        uncomfortable and even affect the shape of your cushions. We evaluate
        the cushions to determine the right amount of stuffing required to
        ensure the perfect balance of comfort and support, while restoring the
        original shape and look of your cushions.

    question:
      "Q. Can you provide details on the type of foam you use? Is it eco-friendly or made from natural latex?",
    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          We use high-resilience (HR) foam, which is durable and comfortable but
          not fully eco-friendly. Some HR foams are certified by organizations
          like CertiPUR-US or OEKO-TEX, meaning they have been tested and
          confirmed to have low VOC emissions and meet specific environmental and
          health standards. Overall, it&apos;s a high-quality option for
          lasting support. HR foam is available in various grades, and we
          generally recommend the standard medium-density grade, HR 35.

    question: "Q. Does all leather crack and split over time?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        If leather is properly cleaned and maintained cracking can be prevented
        for a long period of time. The top color finish can break down and show
        cracking with normal wear. However to prevent your leather from drying
        out use our ReLeather leather conditioner to moisturize your leather.

    question: "Q. If its pigmented leather will it crack and peel?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        No. Applying color or pigment to the leather surface actually makes the
        leather more durable. Leather becomes more brittle with age. It cracks
        as it dries out if the leather is not properly cleaned or cared for.

    question: "Q. Why is Leather better than faux leather and vinyl?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Leather is one of the first known materials to be used to upholster
        furniture. Beside earning the reputation for quality, leather is also
        widely regarded for its durability. Leather upholstery holds a unique
        advantage over other materials such as fabrics and synthetic covers.
        Leather upholstery can be restored and recolored to make your furniture
        look like new again.

    question: "Q. Will can color fade leather?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Yes. Direct and even indirect sun light will fade and damage leather as
        well as direct heat. Leather is a natural product and if not maintained
        will fade resulting in drying out from loss of moisture.

  {
    question: "Q. Will the color or dye rub off?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        No. The leather dyeing process is thorough and will not rub off on
        clothes. We finish the leather with a protective coating that prevents
        color transfer.

        Anyone who has ever owned a leather sofa knows that one of the main
        problems with leather is that it is prone to discoloration. Over time,{" "}
        <strong>leather can fade from exposure to sunlight</strong> or wind up
        looking patchy and worn from daily use. However, not all leather
        surfaces and grades discolor equally, pigmented aniline and semi-aniline
        leathers are considered protected leathers which are more resistant
        against color fading and color transfer due to its pigmented and
        protective surface coating. Pure aniline leathers and those treated with
        waxes and oils generally do not have a protective top coat and tend to
        fade faster which requires extra care. Regardless of leather type,
        professional leather color restoration is your option to{" "}
        <strong>restore and match the original color of your leather</strong> and
        extend the life of your beloved leather sectional or leather chair.

        One of the main problems with all types of leather is that it will dry
        out and crack over time, especially if you don&apos;t apply leather
        conditioner. Moisturizing your leather couch on a regular basis helps
        to keep it supple and prevent surface cracking and premature aging.{" "}
        <strong>
          Excessively dry leather makes leather feel stiff, rough, and thin
        </strong>
        , which can make the leather susceptible to holes or tear damage.
        Leather conditioner helps preserve the natural oils and prevents leather
        from drying out. However, if there are deep cracks along the surface of
        your leather due to excessive dryness (which causes separation),
        you&apos;ll need a leather restoration expert to{" "}
        <strong>bring your leather back to life</strong>. Leather restoration is
        an art, and it takes a skilled leather professional to safely and
        effectively restore leather to its former glory. But if you have a
        cracked leather couch, sectional, or chair that you love, it&apos;s worth
        the investment to have your leather items restored.

        Unfortunately, some leather is notoriously easy to scratch, and even
        the most careful owners can end up with a piece of furniture that looks
        worn and damaged. Light surface scuffs marks can accumulate on aniline
        leathers finished with a combination of oil and wax, but these marks
        can be removed once you rub them out. Deep surface scratches often
        remove the color and tear the grain texture of both unprotected aniline
        and protected aniline. While leather repair kits can be an alternative
        for minor marks on a cushion, they are not generally suitable for more
        serious damage. For extensive abrasions, you will need to search for
        leather restoration services.{" "}

        Keeping your leather clean can be high maintenance because some leather
        easily absorbs spills and spotting from everyday use. The level of
        absorption varies between the different types of leather finishes, some
        are more resistant than others in keeping the stain on the surface of
        the leather. Unfinished aniline leathers, such as pure aniline and
        nubuck,{" "}
        <strong>
          rapidly absorb body oils and moisture into the pores of the leather
        </strong>
        , which will darken the surface area over time due to its lack of
        finish protection. Most protected leathers, such as pigmented and
        semi-aniline, can repel many water spills, because they have pigmented
        top coats and surface protectants. Body oil on pigmented leather builds
        up but stays on the surface. Prevent oils from your hands and head from
        collecting and penetrating your leather by having your upholstery
        routinely cleaned and waterproofed. Normally this problem is seen in
        leather seats, headrests, and armrests of a leather couch. Leather
        repair kits or a leather cleaner are not recommended for this degree of
        spot removal and natural oil extraction. This leather repair task
        requires leather restoration services which would prepare the area,
        extract as much oils as possible, and color match the leather to the
        original color. So let us help fix your stained upholstery furniture.
